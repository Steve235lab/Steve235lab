## About Me

Iâ€™m a graduate student in software engineering at McGill University. I previously worked as a full-time backend engineer (with a senior title) and currently freelance on Mercor and Algora. I build, develop, and self-host online services for my personal use and for friends.

I'm also an open-source contributor, I have contributed to some famous projects, including [lobe-chat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat), [open-interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter), [AudioLDM2](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM2), and [Bert-VITES2](https://github.com/fishaudio/Bert-VITS2). BTW, I support the Free Software Movement by regularly donating ($6/month) to [fsf.org](https://fsf.org/) to achieve their great goals.

## Skill Set

Experienced with Python, Rust, PHP, Java, C/C++ and all other tech stacks to develop and deploy services in containers, on VMs, and with K8S clusters. Have much experience with all major cloud computing service providers, including Apple Cloud Infrastructure, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service, and Alibaba Cloud Service. Senior in backend development and dev-ops.
